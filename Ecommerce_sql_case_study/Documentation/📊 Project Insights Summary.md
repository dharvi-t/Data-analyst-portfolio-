###### **📊 Project Insights Summary**



This project analyzes an e-commerce transactional dataset using advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, window functions, aggregations) to answer real-world business questions related to customer behavior, product performance, and revenue drivers.



🔹 **Q1.** **Revenue Concentration Analysis**



**Question:**

Is the business dependent on a small percentage of customers for revenue?



**Insight:**

Revenue is well distributed across customers. The top customers individually contribute a very small percentage of total revenue, indicating low revenue concentration risk. This suggests a stable customer base where the business is not overly dependent on a few high-spending customers.



**Business Value:**

* Lower risk of revenue loss due to churn of a few customers
* Emphasis should be on broad customer engagement rather than only VIP retention



**🔹 Q2. Top Customers by City**



**Question:**

Who are the top revenue-generating customers in each city?



**Insight:**

Each city has a different top customer, showing that revenue leadership is region-specific rather than dominated by a single national customer.



**Business Value:**

* Enables localized marketing strategies
* Supports city-level loyalty programs and targeted promotions



🔹 **Q3. Product Revenue vs Sales Volume**



**Question:**

Which products drive high revenue versus high sales volume?



**Insight:**

* High-volume products are not always the highest-revenue products.
* Some products sell frequently but generate moderate revenue, while a smaller set of products contributes disproportionately higher revenue with lower volume.



**Business Value:**

* Identifies premium products that drive profitability
* Helps differentiate pricing strategies for volume vs revenue leaders



🔹 **Q4. Customer Purchase Behavior (One-time vs Repeat Buyers)**



**Question:**

How does revenue differ between repeat buyers and one-time buyers?



**Insight:**

Repeat buyers represent ~98% of customers and generate almost all revenue, while one-time buyers contribute a negligible share of revenue.



**Business Value:**

* Strong evidence that customer retention is critical
* Reinforces the importance of loyalty programs and repeat-purchase incentives



🔹 **Q5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Segmentation**



**Question:**

How is revenue distributed across customer value segments?



**Insight:**

* Medium-value customers form the majority and contribute the largest share of revenue
* High-value customers are very few but still significant
* Low-value customers contribute minimal revenue despite their volume



**Business Value:**

* Growth opportunity lies in upgrading medium-value customers to high-value
* Personalized offers can increase lifetime value without over-reliance on a small elite group



**🎯 Overall Business Takeaways**



* Revenue stability is driven by a broad and engaged customer base
* Retention matters more than acquisition
* Product strategy should differentiate between volume drivers and revenue drivers
* Customer value segmentation enables targeted growth strategies
